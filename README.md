# dotfiles

My configuration files for Arch Linux, ZSH and other tools.

Full installation:

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hajdylaf/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/install.sh)"
```

Only sync dotfiles:

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hajdylaf/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/sync.sh)"
```
